# Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

Files: 
  Dijkstra.py  - Contains Graph class.
  Dijkstra_main.py  - Main program to test the Dijkstra's implementation.
  
class Graph features:
  add_edge()  - add a directed edge (and distance/weight) to graph.
  find_distance()-  find shortest distance between 2 vertices.
